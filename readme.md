## 💡&nbsp; what is this?
this is a super minimalistic mvc framework designed to be built in under 30 minutes from scratch because i have to pass a very stupid exam with VERY LIMITED time, with NO ACCESS TO THE FUCKING INTERNET and dude, how the fuck am i supposed to build a full stack web application in just 5 fucking hours, please explain that to me

## 🛠️&nbsp; why might i need that?
well, if you have to pass a similar stupid exam having no access to the internet and frameworks in the future like i do, my hardcoded "framework" might have helped you a lot

## ⌨️&nbsp; database setup
* learn to code sql in terminal
* then type the following commands:
  * ```create database city``` - i think it's obvious
  * ```use city``` - select the created database
  * ```create table city (id int not null auto_increment, name varchar not null, primary key (id))``` - create the example table
* you're welcome

## 👉&nbsp; why is this code so awful? 
we don’t judge people if they still have been learning to code, right?
